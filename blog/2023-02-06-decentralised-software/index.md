In the last few months I have had the chance to work from a coworking space focused on crypto projects. It has been an interesting experience, for several reasons. First I was reminded, once again, how vast and differentiated the world of software actually is. While web development, CRUD or mobile apps make the news that generally reach my attention, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of verticals that I am still  unfamiliar with. Secondly, making friends with developers working in crypto gave me a chance to think more deeply about ideas that I was already familiar with, but that I had never really spent serious time analysing.

Is crypto attempting to give a technical solution to a practical problem? Initially, it definitely looked so. In fact, while Bitcoin definitely made it easier to send and receive funds in a decentralised way, it is also true that most users would still want the backup option of being able to get human assistance when things go South (eg losing their credentials). However, the developers I met at the coworking space often mentioned how they were building new tools to allow for credential recovery and much more. So, it sounds like, as the ecosystem evolves, new, new, more user-friendly tools become available to users and lower the barrier to access to the crypto world. If this is the general trend, then, given enough time, decentralised tools should completely remove the need for a man in the middle. In this sense, maybe we started out 15 years ago with a partial solution, but we are getting closer to a viable system that, besides being technically decentralised, it is also allows for business decentralisation.

This brings about the second consideration: do businesses actually want decentralisation?

### Natural monopolies and conflicts of interest

The fewer options a customer enjoys, the more negotiating power a business has over them; that is, a business has a natural incentive to decrease optionality in the market as much as possible. The question then follows: if businesses have a natural tendency to centralisation, does this not create a conflict of interest with the techical efforts for decentralisation in software?

### Exhibit A: the Internet

The last great example of decentralisation before crypto is the Internet itself. Built on decentralised technology, it was designed to have no single points of failure. Protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP are essentially "public goods" — no one owns them, and anyone can use them to build a service.

However, as the Internet matured, the business layer aggressively centralised. While the "pipes" remained decentralised, the "destinations" became massive silos. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta leveraged network effects—the phenomenon where a service becomes more valuable as more people use it to create digital monopolies. They offered convenience and "free" services in exchange for control over data and user attention. This suggests that technical decentralisation is a necessary but insufficient condition for a truly open ecosystem. Without a way to align economic incentives, the gravity of business will always pull back toward a central hub.

### Exhibit B: email vs instant messaging

A similar dynamic played out with messaging protocols in the form of email and instant messaging (Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram and the likes). Email can effectively be considered a "decentralised" protocol: no single individual or company owns email. Because it is built on open standards (SMTP, IMAP), a Gmail user can message a ProtonMail user, who can then read that message on an iPhone mail client or a Linux terminal. There is no single "CEO of Email" who can decide to shut down the network or force everyone to use the same app. 

On the other hand, instant messaging networks are based on centralised designs. As a result the Slacks and WhatsApps of the world are walled gardens. You cannot send a WhatsApp message to a Slack channel (well, technically it can be done, but they were not built with to function that way). These companies own the entire stack: the protocol, the server, and the interface. The Business Paradox: From a user experience perspective, Slack is often "better" than email. It’s faster, has better emoji reactions, and feels more cohesive. Why? Because centralisation allows for rapid iteration. Slack can push a new feature to every user overnight. Email, being decentralised, takes decades to change because thousands of independent providers have to agree on new standards. As a developer, this is the ultimate "quality vs. sovereignty" trade-off. We often sacrifice the freedom of decentralised protocols (email) for the polished, high-velocity features of centralised products (Slack).

### What are the best use cases for blockchains then?

If business naturally trends toward centralisation for the sake of efficiency, then the best use cases for blockchains are those where trust is more valuable than efficiency. Here are two examples I can think of

* Voting systems

* Philantropy

* Asset registries (land, IP, carbon credits)

* Cross-border settlement

* Infrastructure coordination (energy, compute, identity)

* Situations where exit matters more than UX?

In conclusion, maybe centralisation is not always a bug. Depending on the use case, centralisation is actually one of strongest features, and is needed, especially in the business world not just to guarantee piece of mind, but enable that relative specialisation that's at foundation of any economic system.
