# Pragmatic STS token generation

[STS](https://www.sts.org.za/) is a standard that specifies how to generate tokens to control energy meters and manage the sale of energy, water and gas. In layman terms, STS ensures that the tokens emitted by a metering platform are accepted by the smart meters. STS is widespread in the energy sector in Sub Saharan Africa and, more generally, in the Global South.

Although well-established, STS token generation is surprisingly tricky to implement, so I figured I'd write a quick article about how we achieve STS generation functionality without - the practical way. In particular, I would like to focus not only on the implementation of the functionality itself, but on how, as a software team, we had to leave our pride aside and be very pragmatic despite not being thrilled with the solution. 

### Javascript implementation

### Uh, we found an open source library that does exactly this!

After much searching, a colleague found a library
